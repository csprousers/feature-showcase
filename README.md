## CSPro Feature Showcases

This repository contains CSPro "feature showcases." Starting in 2015, with CSPro 6.2, beta releases were broadcast along with a feature showcase. This was a CSPro application that demonstrated new features introduced for that release. Not every release came with a feature showcase, but this repository is a collection of the ones that were created.

This repository's [main branch](https://github.com/csprousers/feature-showcase) contains all feature showcases, updated to the latest version of CSPro. Each version's feature showcase, as distributed, is in a separate branch named after the release version. Because of changes to CSPro over time, the version in that branch may no longer work with the latest version of CSPro, so if you are interested in exploring new features&mdash;now old&mdash;you should use the updated versions found in the main branch.
